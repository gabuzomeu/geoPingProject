         * WARNING: Locally generating a random string when starting a purchase and
         * verifying it here might seem like a good approach, but this will fail in the
         * case where the user purchases an item on one device and then uses your app on
         * a different device, because on the other device you will not have access to the
         * random string you originally generated.
         *
         * So a good developer payload has these characteristics:
         *
         * 1. If two different users purchase an item, the payload is different between them,
         *    so that one user's purchase can't be replayed to another user.
         *
         * 2. The payload must be such that you can verify it even when the app wasn't the
         *    one who initiated the purchase flow (so that items purchased by the user on
         *    one device work on other devices owned by the user).
         *
         * Using your own server to store and verify developer payloads across app
         * installations is recommended.
