<b>GeoPing :</b> 
This application was created on request of a friend who wanted to geo-locate his child who had just got a phone with a limited package. This would help him to be sure that his child would well back home .


The principle:
<ul>
<li> Geolocation of a contact by sending a text message that provides position between two phones</li>
<li> SMS query GeoPing (like ping linux): this request will be intercepted if and only if the target phone have first installed the application Geoping.</li>
</ul>
<p>
=> Once the message have been sent it would disappeared next and then the phone "applicant" would received a reply SMS with the phone's GPS position in an obfuscated form (a human can not read it).
</p>
<br>
<u><b> Benefits: </b></u>
<ul>
<li> Confidentiality, data protection and backup</li>
<li> A basic phone with SMS subscription is cheaper than a subscription with Datas</li>
<li> Sending an SMS consumes less battery</li>
<li> Enabling the localization demand increases the phone's standby</li>
<li> The use of SMS as a communication protocol increases the level of network coverage and Edge allows the application to be able to geo-locate any place cut.</li>
<li> Unlike other systems that use 3G Data (eg Latitude) GeoPing is 100% functional</li>
<li> Use maps OpenStreet Map allows you to complete the online maps and use maps and more representative of your environment GeoPing.</li>
</ul>
 
<u><b>Features:</b></u>
<ul>
<li> Securing information: GPS positions do not pass between you and the telephone company.</li>
<li> Obfuscation and protocol optimization by SMS</li>
<li> A GeoPing SMS count like an SMS Operator: GeoPing SMS messages are designed to use character ranges and not exceed the length triggering over-invoicing operator SMS.</li>
<li> Secure pairing with 3 modes of association (Secure, Authorized or on request)</li>
<li> Ability to display or not a notification to each request GeoPing</li>
<li> Map Open Street Map (OSM), online editable</li>
<li> Vector map for use with low network</li>
<li> Widget to send its position or ask</li>
<li> Link to Google StreetMap points and Navigation</li>
</ul>
